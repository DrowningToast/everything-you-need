It would be great if we have some tool that can auto-generate outfit styles that match with user's brand logo. By the way, we can start from simple thing like picking color from logo, adding them to color picker like Canva did (image attached).

- In web development we can just use somethings like

  `const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");`

  Then, use `ctx.getImageData(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height)` for getting the image pixels.
  With those pixels, we can re- arrange to the new palette of color that we want.

  After we can do this success, we can think about how to auto generate style from these color palettes.
